# MEGA2560StarterKit - The most complete starter kit
MEGA 2560 Project (Arduino-like board)

##Introduction
This project exists to document my journey with this board. Mi wife gave me this as a birthday gift and I was so happy to get it.
Also this will help me get introduced to the git world and practice my collaborative professional skills in order to make the next step on my career!

The kit I'm using is from ELEGOO [(click here to see the supporting docs)](https://www.elegoo.com/pages/arduino-kits-support-files)
The board is MEGA 2560 (similar to arduino mega board) based on the ATMEL 2560 microcontroller: [ATmega2560 datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf)


##Lesons I've covered
So far, I've completed the Digital I/O lesson and decided to make a traffic light indicator. Which covers Lesons 1, 2 and 3 from the starter manual.
